After a few years of inactivity I am trying to restart blogging and I thought I'd give Jekyll a try instead of my old Wordpress blog.
Let's see if I will be able to write some blogposts in the next coming weeks... So get back here in a month and see what happened...

Instead of Wordpress, I'm now using Github Pages generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). We'll see if that works....
